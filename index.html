            People who buy online. When you make a payment, you can choose how
            you want to pay for your purchases:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              If you have sufficient PayPal balance to cover the payment, the
              amount will be deducted directly.
            </li>
            <li>
              If you have linked a credit or debit card to your PayPal account,
              the payment amount can be deducted from your credit or debit card
              after you've depleted your PayPal balance.
